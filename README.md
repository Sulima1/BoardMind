# BoardMind
A competitive chess engine created using deep learning techniques

## Abstract
Our machine learning final project aims to design and develop a cutting-edge chess engine, BoardMind, which leverages machine learning techniques to play chess effectively. The primary objectives are to teach the engine chess intricacies and train it for high-level comprehension and skill. The methodology will involve deep learning and decision tree methods.

The project includes data collection, feature engineering, model development, training, evaluation, and iterative improvement. We will gather historical chess games, preprocess the data to extract relevant features, and explore deep learning architectures (CNNs and RNNs) alongside decision tree methods (Alpha-Beta pruning and MCTS). The model will be trained using supervised learning techniques and possibly reinforcement learning through self-play.

BoardMind's performance will be evaluated against existing chess engines and human players, using metrics like the ELO rating system, win-loss ratios, and game quality. Evaluation results will inform iterative refinements to improve the model's architecture, hyper parameters, and training data.

Upon completion, BoardMind is expected to be a sophisticated chess engine demonstrating high comprehension and skill in playing chess. This project will contribute to AI research in strategy games and provide valuable insights into machine learning algorithms' capabilities.
